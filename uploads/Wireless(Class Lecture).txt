***dB, dBm, dBi

***Band: Study details about Dual Band

***Channel: Study details.

-> Signal to noise ratio(SNR)
If it is greater than 25 then it is okay.

****AP works in two modes:
***Fat AP: Work independently completing all functions without controller. Small network.
***Fit AP: Controlled by Access Controller. Used in large scale networks.

VVI: 802.11 protocol family
802.11b - 11Mbps, 2.4GHz, 3 channel, 20MHz
802.11n(Dual Band) - 600Mbps, 2.4GHz+5.8GHz

***Multi-Input Multi-Output
Does AP interacts simultaneously with everyone connected to it?

Fit AP:						
Local forwarding: Forwarded by AP as Ethernet frame transformed from Radio Frame
Centralized forwarding: AP send Radio Frame to AC and AC forward it as Ethernet Frame.

Trunk Port: The port of switch through which more than one VLAN passes.
Access port: The port through which only one VLAN pass.
